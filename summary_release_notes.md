The latest update focuses on modifications to GitHub actions workflows, specifically the 'release.yml' workflow. With it, the 'release.yml' workflow is set to trigger on both 'dev' and 'main' branches and has been given additional write permissions. This includes an added permissions block that gives the workflow write access to push commits to the contents of the repository automatically.
